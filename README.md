I’m currently developing a personal project: an application that will host a variety of games for users to play. Right now, I’m working on creating a Hangman game, which has been a lot of fun. My goal with this project is to expand and deepen my skills in JavaScript and React. I chose React as the framework for this application to enhance my knowledge of React while simultaneously building my JavaScript skills through game development.
